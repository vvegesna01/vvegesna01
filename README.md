### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Keerthana**, a *Software Engineer*, and a *Web Developer* at the **Purdue John Martinson Honors College**.

I have experience with cloud technologies, front-end development, full-stack, and data-driven research. I'm still early in my career so I'm always learning new technologies and growing!

Check out my most recent project: [Shelf This - A Reading Dashboard](https://shelfthis.streamlit.app/). The next update will generate the dashboard from your own imported goodreads/storygraph data!

I have been a *Software Engineering Intern* at **Cummins, Inc** and  an *Undergraduate Teaching Assistant* for **The Data Mine**, and *CS Bridge Program* at Purdue.

I have also had the opportunity to contribute as an *Undergraduate Student Researcher* for **Merck** through the **The Data Mine Corporate Partner's Program**. I also participated in the **Girls Who Code College Loop** and as part of the TEDxPurdueU Logistics team, helped organize the 2020 TEDx event.
