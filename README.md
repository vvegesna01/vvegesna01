### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Keerthana**, a senior at **Purdue University** studying Computer Science.

I am passionate about solving complex problems through software development and leveraging data to drive insights. 

I am driven by a curiosity to explore new technologies and find innovative solutions and am excited to continue my journey in computer science, constantly learning and growing.


I have been a *Software Engineering Intern* at **Cummins, Inc** and have been an *Undergraduate Teaching Assistant* for **The Data Mine** and for the *CS Bridge Program* at Purdue.

I have also had the opportunity to contribute as an *Undergraduate Student Researcher* for **Merck** through the **The Data Mine Corporate Partner's Program**. I also participated in the **Girls Who Code College Loop** and as part of the TEDxPurdueU Logistics team, helped organize the 2020 TEDx event.
